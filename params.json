Unzip the file db/dev_melo_db.sql.zip and import it into your MySQL database.\r\n2.  Create a virtual host on your webserver called \"melodramatic\" and point it at the core/ folder.\r\n3.  Copy the file core/sites/default/default.settings.php to settings.php and edit the database settings.\r\n4.  Visit http://melodramatic/ in a web browser.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* You can use any vhost you want (such as \"localhost\") so long as you have a working sites/melodramatic => sites/default symbolic link.\r\n* If you get a WSOD (White screen of death) check your webserver error logs or edit the index.php file and insert a \"ini_set('display_errors', 1);\" up at the top.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!"}
